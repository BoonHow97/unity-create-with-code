## Projects

### 01: Driving Simulator
**Focus:** Vehicle physics and camera systems

Fixed camera lag by moving follow logic to `LateUpdate()`. Added split-screen local multiplayer.

### 02: Food Flight
**Focus:** Object pooling and spawning systems

Debugged spawn boundary logic. Implemented wave-based enemy spawning.

### 03: Jump Force
**Focus:** Animation state machines and audio integration

Resolved animation state transitions for jump/death sequences. Added particle effects for player movement.

### 04: Sumo Battle
**Focus:** Physics-based gameplay

Implemented knockback mechanics using distance-based force calculations. Created multiple power-up types.

### 05: Clicky Mouse
**Focus:** UI systems and game state management

Built difficulty selection menu. Implemented persistent score tracking across game states.
